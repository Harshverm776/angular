## @Input & @Output

Both are used to transform the data from one component to another component.  

- **@Input-**  
decorator in a child component or directive to let Angular know that a property in that component can receive its value from its parent component.

- **@Output-**  
decorator binds a property of a component, to send data from one component to the calling component. @Output binds a property of the type of angular EventEmitter class. To transfer the data from child to parent component, we use @Output decorator.

## Routing

allows the users to create a single-page application with multiple views and allows navigation between them. Users can switch between these views without losing the application state and properties.
